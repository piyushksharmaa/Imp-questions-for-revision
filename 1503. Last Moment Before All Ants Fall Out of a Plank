Approach: In this question there is kind of trick that as ants are of similar kind we can avoid considering about collisions and let them move without collisions and 
          then finding simply without collisions how much time will they take to fall out of the plank.
          
          
class Solution {
public:
    int getLastMoment(int n, vector<int>& left, vector<int>& right) {
        int max_time=0;
        for(int i=0;i<int(left.size());i++){
            max_time=max(left[i],max_time);
        }
        for(int i=0;i<int(right.size());i++){
            max_time=max(n-right[i],max_time);
        }
        return max_time;
    }
};
