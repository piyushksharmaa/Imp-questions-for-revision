// So, in this question we have to find the maximum score so that all the conditions holds true.
// For age restrictions that we can't choose a player with score higher if its age is lower than someone whose score // is lower and age is greater so we are making another vector of {ages,scores} and sort them in ascending order of 
// ages so we don't have to worry about age anymore and we just have to find LIS now.

// Here we are finding LIS by checking if my previous player(j) score is lower than my current player(i) score then 
// we can choose that player score so this is our only condition.

// For dp array we have to consider that we are starting our prev from -1, so we have to use [j+1] so we need not to // worry about negative indices.
